Importance of Devops in SDLC

1. Faster Time to Market:
   DevOps practices, such as Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD), streamline the development and deployment processes,
    allowing teams to deliver features and updates more quickly.
2. Improved Collaboration:
   DevOps fosters a culture of collaboration between development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams, breaking down silos and enhancing communication. 
   This leads to better teamwork and alignment on goals.
3. Higher Quality Software:
   Automated testing and monitoring ensure that software is consistently tested and validated throughout the development cycle,
   reducing the likelihood of bugs and improving overall software quality.
