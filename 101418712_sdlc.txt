Importance of Learning DevOps in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

Introduction to SDLC:
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that outlines the stages of software development, from planning and design to implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

What is DevOps?
DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops), aiming to shorten the development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.

Enhancing Collaboration:
DevOps fosters collaboration between development and operations teams, breaking down silos and improving communication. This collaboration leads to a more integrated approach to software development, which is crucial in the SDLC.
